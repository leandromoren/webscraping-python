Subtitle Improved by - Rubayed Hello. Yes, you. Lean slightly towards your left. Don't worry. Is it ready? Ready. Start sound. Similar to enjoy some form of animal dancing... ...audience enjoy my dance. Whenever I think about it, I feel like vomiting. It is not some art. But, I need a way to live my life. I have one type of hunger, those seeing me has other type of hunger. I peel myself for their cash. That's it. If I had known that I would dance half-naked like this... I would have died before I born. Play one song. You come from there to the centre and rotate your hip and turn into circle. Shall we go for a rehearsal? Getting late! Sound cut, sound cut. What? I must go. Let's take a shot and we will finish it off. Okay. What happened. Why are you laughing? Nothing, dear. I thought the leaf of waist will fall, but, here it's the head which is falling. What happened? The whole thing is stupid. the movie, the process... ...people like you who are sitting and enjoying! I'm disgusted by the whole thing. See, it's just an ash print. Not the whole film. Yeah, by the way, Arun... this is Manju, art director. This is Arun, director of the film. Just how a person with monkey make it dance and earn money... ...you are earning by making women dance? You see, Miss... Shit. Only now I introduced Manju to you. You are forgetful on women's matter. See, Miss Manju. It's just a part of my documentary. Actually, my documentary is based on women. Why? Beedi, cigarettes, soap are getting boring? See, this is purely business. They make films based on the market. And, market will always be there for women. So, you're saying, women are equivalent to selling goods? See, Miss Manju. I am not making this film to insult or humiliate women. Actually, I sympathise with the Cabaret Dancer. I am angry on those, who are harassing her like this. Using my documentary. I... Hey, hey, hey... Stop, man. Let me finish my work and leave. Then, it's between you and Manju. Look, Manju. Either you like the film or not, you have to help Arun to complete the film. Me? Yes, you only, please. You will understand my purpose later. The moment you feel disinterest on the project or the film you can exit. Say okay I say. Ah? Okay. - Okay. - Thank you. Where is my appreciation? Lights. Look straight. Smile lightly. What sir, all ready? What is this, dear? We are making an ad of bathing soap. That's why, photoshoot is happening. But, you are here as to advertise for a saree shop! Look, this is soap. Not a tooth powder packet. Go and remove these and wear a bath towel exposing the shoulders. Please. No, mother will scold me. Why? Press media will see me, madam. Oh, oh! If nobody sees, you will pose anyway, right? Mother won't say anything, right? - That... - Listen, dear. Do you know why we selected you? Besides your face, your body also looks beautiful. Or else, I would've posed, no? Go fast, wear towel and come, dear. Don't waste time. Come on. I'm giving you an entire day. Go home, think if it's the only way to save your honor or not and come tomorrow. You will get a lot of money, Say this to your mother. She will understand. Hello, Mr. Arun. She brought her honor to the press. It might not be as difficult as your filmmaking, but... ...these are some cases demand. No, no. This is also difficult work. Sir, don't say anything to please me. As per my boss order, I'm here with a job to do. You can speak openly. I like you very much. Okay? Awkward joke. What is your film based on? About awkwardness. I mean about women's. The title of the film is 'One Half of the Whole Sky.' If our society is a sky, the half of it is women. The title seems to be a poetry. Have you keep it so that everyone gets hooked by the title itself? No, there is a purpose of this title. The title isn't a bait for others to get hooked. I have some ideas on present days situation around women. - As example. We're thinking women as slave... - Best of luck. Thank you. Do you believe, you can change every women's situation with your one film? Tying a girl in bath towel with... ...a soap in hand, if you believe soap will sold out, then... No. It's not my belief. It's Soap company's. - Whatever it is, I'm saying... - That's all right. What do you want me to do now? At first, let's not talk like strangers, okay? Agreed. See, I am searching for some women. Is it women or money? - Don't be like this! - Okay. Whom do you want to meet? As you are the head of the Seva trust, we are here for an interview. I didn't give any interview till today. Did anybody been here before to interview you? Hmm... many presses came here. I only said, it's not possible. Because, I am very busy you see! What are you going to say for us now? You see, I am making a documentary film on women. I feel your presence should be there. Are you doing a cinema? For that, I have to do makeup and all, is it? Yes. The makeup you do everyday for the society, that's enough. Okay, okay. Mm... wait. Come. Move the chair. I don't need it here. Place madam in the centre. Okay, ready? I'll ask questions which you have to answer on the mic. Don't look at camera. It doesn't look natural. You talk as usual, okay? Camera ready? Light, fan. Start. How many woman are there in your protection? Approximately, 25 women. What type of woman are you allowing? Those who did crimes. The place is for those, who failed in their lives. Alright. While you kept them alone or seperate... ...have you noticed any change in their thoughts to do crime? Coffee is here, take it. No problem. Let us drink afterwards. Okay. Is there any motive for you to do the social service? What motive do you expect me to have? I have a soul desire in this. So, if your soul desire has to be continued... ...many woman have to continue failing in their lives, isn't it? How many children do you have? Two son's and two daughter's. What do they think about your service? - They are proud of my service. - Is it? Will you permit your son to marry a girl from your trust? I always believe in freedom of an independent person. They should take their own decisions in life. I am very determined on that. Very convenient answer. Why? Don't you feel it or do your son's don't believe in reformation? At least, it's enough to treat women of your house without any degration. Excuse me, a small question finally. What do you think of your job? It's not a job. It's a service. To bring prosper & justice to the society... ...four good hearted people... Cut it. You should've been there. Her sweat of shame on face would've filled four buckets. From your words, Arun seems to be very mischievous. No, no. Nothing like that. But, he is a different character. From the questions he asked, I understood, he had clear ideas on it. So, you liked Arun very much? I see you frequently with him. Nothing doing. He invited me for a coffee, soon after the interview. I replied, I am going home & left the place. Why? I know, what he is going to ask next. While drinking coffee, he will ask about me. Then, without waiting for my question, he will say about himself. Unknowingly, his hand will fall on me. His foot will rub me. Why bother to these nonsense! I don't know how you can act like this? You behave like children, who put moustache on face before sleep. It's okay. You have no faith on men. So, helping on his film is past tense from today? No, no. That will go on it's way. Helping is one thing. Rubbing is another. Isn't it? I think I am giving you a lot of trouble. No. If not this, I would've been doing something else. One minute, I am coming. Make yourself comfortable. Don't worry. You cook yourself & eat? Where are your parents? My parents are in Coimbatore. Father is a businessman. Okay, where is your family? My father is... Mother is in Paris. Father is also there in embassy. Are you living here alone? No, no. l am with my cousin. Why didn't you go to Paris? I can go, If I wish. But, I like it here. Okay, you will drink coffee, right? What else can we do here? Let's drink coffee. Are you a communist? Why? You have kept Marx book. I wish to know everything. So, I read this. Why? If I am communist, what's wrong in it? I hate the red colour. It should be your eye's problem. You will earn lot of money by making a film, isn't it? That's not my only aim. Having an unusual proffession become a fashion nowdays. - I believe in my work. - I don't believe you. Okay. Sunday, we are going to meet Janaki. - Janaki? - Playback Singer. - Oh... - Bye. What are you thinking, buddy? Is it about any woman? No, no. When a man is alone, he will think of a lady or his own luck. What are you thinking about? Surely, it can't be about women. Not about a lady, but about ladies. Because they always gets cheated. Hey, buddy. I don't know about liberty or equality. But, one thing. Two things should be tasted and appreciated. One is Wine. The other is Women. Be it by birth, or in habits or even in the bedroom... ...men & women can never be equal. Specifically in bedroom, there is no room for equality. See, it's useless arguing with you. You are a prejudiced ass. Yes, I am a Male ass. Okay, leave it. How is your your documentary work. Then, how's Manju? Is she helping you nice? Okay. Proceeding well. Manju is innocent. She is having some disturbance in her mind. I think the reason behind her critical behaviour is... ...caused by some misery of her past. Hey, buddy. A bad bag spoiling a good subject. Don't you know? Mother went behind other men. Daughter and father tolerates her to certain extent. When the opportunity struck, the man divorce her. Then, how? How could Manju be happy? What? Whom are you talking about? All about your Manju's history. Too stinky. Why Manju didn't marry? Hey, who will marry her? It's for people with stable mind. She is unstable. Try discussing marriage with her. She will say, she has no faith in such drama. - Oh. - Hey, hey, hey... Why do you bother about it? Look. Women and Politicians belong to same category. They will go to any extent to achieve their goal. But, they don't know what their goal is. See, buddy. Be careful. Okay, forget it. Today, there is a hot film in the film society. Interested? No, thanks. You proceed. Do this. There's a religious film playing in Kamadhenu theatre. Go & watch it. You think your youth will always be with you? Play when your are capable. Go, man. Wonderful... design! Manju, you are beautiful. Your design gets influenced by it. You know? When you first time came here for a job... I didn't see your certificates. Your body... Sorry! I see your face. It's enough for a job. Normally, I like women very much. Wheather they are children, or youth, if they look beautiful, l just love them. Sir, put the signature. Pen...? I like women when they are angry too... One thing. Don't think I have crass, cheap opinion on girls. In the world, two things you have to handle very carefully. One is Women. The other is Culture. By the way, I met Arun now. He said, you are helping him nicely. I told him to interact with you without any fear or hesitation. I think the film's output will be interesting. You like it too, isn't it? I don't like it. Me too. Boring thing means the documentary, if it shows, I'll get out for a smoke. Not like that, I like documentary films, but the way they make it... - What they say? - Taking method. - I don't like the taking method. But, Mr. Arun's subject is too good, we have to congratulate him for that. Congratulate him then. Oh, Manju. Will you discuss whatever we spoke here with Arun? Should I? Nothing like that. I also felt after watching Arun's documentary... ...there is no safety for women in our country. If a man has willpower and money, to safeguard more than one lady... ...then the law should allow the man to marry more than one lady. They are talking about Monogamy & all... no, no, no! That's practically impossible. Too hard. They say it for sake. Don't think, I am talking in a sex motive. Sir, firstly, do your first marriage. He is not even worth of first marriage... ...and talking on polygamy, you're thinking? Okay, leave. Look, you can't fool me. I heard your comments. I care a foot for your comments. When I see someone speaking at the back of anyone, I feel hasty. Like the coward who writes in the bathroom. If you have guts, come and talk to me straightly. "She walks wearing stylish saree." "She wanders with dozen men." "She talks freely about sex." These are your topic, isn't it? Whatever dress I wear, it suits me. What can I do? If you have three children and done 30 abortion and can't wear anything... ...so, you are jealous of me? "She is talking freely about sex." Am I talking to have free sex? Or, do you feel shame that I don't discuss sex with you. "She roams with many men." That's my wish. If I wish, I will roam with your husband too... You are insulting me. I will go and report now to the managing director. Go with pleasure. He is always behind me only. Come. Wait for a minute. Let me finish this. What? Anger? - One minute's anger will affect entire day's happiness. - Look... I hate living in ignorance. I hate hypocrites. I don't like people put on a mask. They will talk like this. You should ignore them. I would've done that. If they will be like that then, I will be like this. You're going to face many difficulties. I don't care. I hate people who want honor... ...believing themselves above their worth. So, you are saying that you don't like yourself? What do you mean? Unwanted prestige, double life, double standard... ...believing themselves above their worth & all... suits you. Shut up. Or else, why would you sent your parents to imaginary Paris? Get away from here. Hello, Arun. Who is this? Manju. Come fast to the news centre. Manju, why do you call so late? Anything wrong? Yes. Are you coming? Arun, if I say about myself, even if the story seems bad... ...sometimes I think it will be the utmost truth. Arun, are you getting bored... ...coming here for me during midnight? No. Why are you thinking something and talking in some other ways? I feel so happy, you personally called & wished to talk to me. I feel scared thinking, how can I change like this? I can't say, I enjoyed my childhood as other childrens. I also had a house. There was a father... ...and mother. But, our house was a crushed one. Yes. A broken home. I also had some happy moments in my childhood. I still remember the things happened in my childhood. It was mixed with dream and reality. Thoughts which come across as dream. It's very sweet. But, the reality is bitter. Does every reality seems to be bitter, Arun? I also had some laugh and dance in my teenage. I liked to play hide and seek in those days. We can't see with open eyes during the game. Have you played this game, Arun? All my dreams of those days disappear when I begin to see. When my bangles broke at an unexpected time like that, my life too broken away. Manju. Why didn't you came to house? Yesterday, a man came with your mother... ...very tall and fat. Was it your father? When I saw my mom in that situation, the world around me broken into pieces. Mom, the great lady in my mind fall away from the highest place and died. Even my friends knew about my mother. What answer I could've given to their questions? I sat alone and cried without going to house at evening. That was the last time I cried in my life. After that, whatever bad thing happens... ...I hide my feelings without showing it to others. From there on, she used to carry me along her, everywhere she goes. I was there like a dumb witness. My mother thought about her happiness, not about my pain. Father is not here, uncle. I know. Mother is also not here, uncle. I know that too. Are you studying? Study... study... Uncle, leave me... Uncle, leave me... Similar to a sudden attack to a person... ...who is standing without any weapons... At an age of mischiefs, many experience attacked me beyond my understanding. I felt like an orphan. I thought to say everything to my dad. Should I say now? Should I say now? One day, dad discovered everything. What does a father can do to comprehend? Despite recognising my mother as a drainage, he continued living in that. Sad. Manju, have you eaten? Hey, stop there. Why are you so late? Can't you see? Oh, are you telling me, you went to temple? Or precisely to meet somebody in temple? Why are you talking like this? If anybody hears, they will laugh... Whole town is already laughing. You are trusting those waste neighbours of ours, isn't it? They are circulating lies, dear. I am saying the truth. Trust me. I promise on my Sutra. Trust me. Don't lie. Why are you beating me? Don't beat me. What are you doing? You made me ashamed. - You are worst. - Don't beat you? Hey, donkey... ...how can you do this when we have a teenage girl at home. I will kill you. Wife, Husband, Family. I lost all my respect and trust on those words. It seems to me like a slogan of political procession... ...which eventually gets meaningless. As I didn't like it at home, often I used to run away from there. There is a proverb, if the ghosts rule, dead bodies will eat sastras. ...our home was also like that. Eventhough, I was living with my parents, I grown up alone. I have the same feeling now. Sometime in everyone's presence, I felt alone. A feeling of having no connection with anything. Because, I had no friends to share anything. Why are you not saying anything? I really didn't felt anything while listening to you. Having lot of experiences in one's life that even in childhood is a great thing. If I feel sad on one side, I feel jealous on another. My head is already very cold. You don't have to keep ice there with your words. Come. Let's have a hot cup of coffee. - No. - For me. Why are you not coming to temple? My skills are not working with this God... ...even if I speak in insulting manner, no reply. If there is no reaction, what's the use of talking to a stone? Nowdays, you seem to be very busy... What busy? House, then office or to roam with Arun somewhere. So, you liked this film job? No. Do you like Arun? I like the way you talk. Hey, Manju. Didn't you thought that he is a different character? I don't know. But, the burdens I am taking are bought by him. So, you guys are going for shopping regularly? How foolish! I didn't mean that. I'm able to speak with him openly. I scolded him on that day in one mood and felt sad. I felt why did I do that? I called him directly to say, why I behaved in that manner. And, I told everything about my parents. So, you have become close with him. What do you mean? If you are not close with him, why would you say about family matter? No no, not like that. I felt to say, so I said. Anyway, Manju. If you have a friend like him, I am also happy. Is the location okay for you? But, if they don't allow for shooting? Why are you worrying about that? You will get it. I came here already before. When? With Manju. Wrong, dear. Why so eccentric? Is she co-operating with you nicely? It is very astonishing. Why? She won't socialise with anybody steadily. Very unpredictable woman. She is in touch with you continuously, so I asked. What is there in it? If anybody else was there, no problem. But, she! She is very hard nut to crack. - Why do you hate women so much? - What? Hatred? If my hatred comes over women, I'll commit suicide. What is life without them? Go, man. You are saying about making documentary on women and all. I have written a poetry on women. "Enjoy the woman. Don't experiment." "Let she follow you. Don't follow her."' "Search the girl. Don't search her heart." "Dont get fooled by a woman. Dont get fooled for a woman." "Hey, friend, Iron is not the only metal that bends..." "...women too bends." Enough, enough. I have no time to listen your poetry. Good night. Whom do you want? I want to meet Manju. l am Manju's friend. Everyone comes here & say the same. My name is Arun. Oh, you are that Arun? About me, Manju... I know, I know. You are the film director, isn't it? Why sir? Will you make only documentary films? Won't you make good films with smart heroes? Who will see your documentary film, sir? Who are you to Manju? Sister. Will it take time for her to come? It's her time to come. She doesn't think this place as home... ...for her, it's hotel. She will come and go by her wish. Why? Any important news? No. We have to meet one person for my film. Who's that? Playback Singer, Janaki. Janaki who sang, "Machana Pathingala?" I only know "Singaravelane" Janaki. You are taking her with you to Janaki's house? While going for an interview, if a girl is with us, it looks good. Girl? Manju? Hmm! How would you see good time having company of bad luck? Your fate. l have some work inside. Inform me once when you leave. I have to lock the door. What happened, Manju? Why are you so dull? We can't find reason for everything. It's not necessary as well. You always seem to be happy. But, today you are very silent. - That's why, I asked. - Nothing. While we are walking together, it seems you are walking alone. What are you thinking about? Your sister talked about you in a different way. What does she said? Tell me. She said to me, "Leave my sister and go alone to Janaki's house." Oh, nice. Only that much she said. Innocent aunt. What? Are you shocked? The person whom she called as sister, now calling her as aunt. Yes, she is my aunt. Father's sister. She took pity on me... ...and kept me in her house. But, why she treat you like this? She feels pride on the fact that she kept me in her house. Okay, leave it. But, she is treating you like this... Arun. I am not responsible for my situation. l am forced to the situation. Okay. Don't ask about this anymore. See... - I... - Keep quiet. - l am sorry. - Please, don't spoil this evening. Taxi. There is no waterflow in the river for the lifeboat to cross There is no waterflow in the river for the lifeboat to cross There is no chariot in the town for anyone to go in the chariot Somewhere, something, someone There is no waterflow in the river for the lifeboat to cross There are fences between the beautiful stage and wonderful music An unhealed wound and hundreds of thorns are there in the swinging legs Feminity doesn't see happiness in anything Feminity doesn't see happiness in anything Is the girl a unburnt light? There is no waterflow in the river for the life boat to cross There are stages everywhere in the town with disguise kings. They are not real kings There are gardens everywhere in the town with scented rose They are not roses truly.. Feminity is not elevated in the world. Feminity is not elevated in the world. Girls are useless flowers There is no waterflow in the river for the lifeboat to cross There is no chariot in the town for anyone to go in the chariot Somewhere, something, someone There is no waterflow in the river for the lifeboat to cross What, sir? You said you have some questions to ask. Why are you trimming your eyebrow? I mean, why are you doing it artificially? If everything goes natural, who would enjoy then? In cinema, for audience enjoyment... ...especially, for men's enjoyment... ...you are putting makeup. Don't you feel like a slave? Sir, I think you have lot's of free time. So, by having these weird thoughts you are confusing your mind. See. In the morning, I had Heroine character who fought for her virginity. In daytime, I was prostitute... ...and a princess in the night. There is no time to think about these, sir. Check, check. Check, check. What's your opinion on the world of cinema? Everybody willingly watches cinema. But, There are people who have wrong idea on film actresses. When a girl stands before a camera... ...they think, she must've lost her virginity. I feel very hasty. Why sir? The women outside the cinema world... ...can pour rain with their innocence? Please forgive me for saying like this. No, carry on. It's surprising to know about the tragedy of this world. It is the world of cinema... ...and people write stories around it. Oh, I forgot. Sundaramurthy brother, 'Kumaran arts' has... ...asked call sheets for tomorrow morning. Tell them it's impossible. What are you blabbering? Spit out and tell them my words. What were you saying? Oh, sorry. I was saying... In cinema world, both tragedy and comedy exists equally. There is something stuck above your eyes. Nothing, it's jigina. Again today, I'm going to act in a love scene. You also come and watch. l am sure you will enjoy it. What, Manju? While shooting, you begin to laugh infront of them in the set itself? Sorry, Arun. They talked about their love, isn't it? Love, our love is so scared and holy... ...I felt like vomiting. l was unble to bear that. They said what they know. Mr. Arun Love, affection, care... these words have no meaning at all. All are lies. You may not believe these... ...but, for that, doing this, in insulting manner... No, Arun. I am not insulting. I laughed when I saw the false side of love. l am not a person who doesn't know or understand love. I lost my family and it's happiness in my childhood. Now, my mind is searching it everywhere. When I was into a deep mud hole, I met Kirupa. Kirupa was studying along with me. He had every characteristics, which a charismatic young man could have. Then, what! Love was destined, isn't it? So, it happened. When it was a massive task to even talk to a boy... ...I can go anywhere with him according to my wish seemed great fortune to me. I was happy thinking, what I have is something many can't afford to have. If I think of it now, it seems funny. We also rambled around beaches, theatres, hotels... ...like lovebirds of press & cinema. I begin to think, my misery faded away. And the happiness which... ...I have is stable and true. Our love is holy and sacred are words we repeated regularly then, you know... ...like we heard in that cinema shooting. 'l am not without him. He is not without me.' were regular words in our conversation. Now those things seems to be mad. But, those happiness... ...wound my scattered heart. Kirupa was like someone, whom we met after losing our way in a deep forest. I felt Kirupa has filled my void, which was created by my family. I was in heaven those days, while l was getting cheated. My mom has killed me for the first time. And, he killed me for the second time. Stones are getting empty. Shall I collect some and give you? You said, "you have an important news to tell." Won't you tell me that? Actually... I had thought to say it, day before yesterday. We also met that day, no? Yes. We have met. Why didn't you said then? Father... ...has fixed my engagement. So, when are we having the wedding feast? Manju, don't you know about my family's situation? I have two sisters at marriageable age. Manju. Bridegroom's family said, they will arrange a job for me, after marriage. What happened, Manju? Why are you not speaking? Manju. Don't think, I didn't love you. I don't know what to do in this situation. If I think about you... For Me... For Me... What is there to talk? He tried to pacify me saying other things. But, when we rambled around, he never remembered his father... ...mother, sisters and marriage. Did he? I feel pity, when I think about him. But, I understood, it wasn't cowardness. It is the carelessness of every youth. I only pity that bastard. In the chocolate advertisement, your designs were exquisite. It's an old one. But, you are really a genius. How do you get these type of ideas? Oh, that? Daily, I get up at 3'o clock. I drink a glass of milk... ...then, I run fast along the beach. I close my eyes tightly. And sing loudly near water. I get the idea immediately. Are you scared? What idea? Turn and see four foreign magazines, ideas will flourish. I thought, they are your own ideas. The skill is to hide the art of stealing. Chandran, take that cello tape. Open. Chandran, what is your age? Nineteen completed. - Do you go to temple? - Yes, I go daily. - Do you have girlfriends? - No, no. I don't have. If I ask you to sleep with me? Will you? No, you are like my sister. Like Sister? You shouldn't touch anywhere to your sister's body. Chant mantras, wash your hands and come back. Go. - Why are you degrading the relation? - You are wro... - Get out. Why are you staring at me like an eagle? Manju, don't be angry. I think you unnecessary angered on him. What Chandran did was wrong. You may leave it in ease... ...or you should punish him. But, you bursted out. If I could, I would've burnt him out. I would've forgiven, if Chandran alone was doing such mistakes. Every other Chandran, Indran, Kuppan, Suppan... ...I met, has done the same. - You are speaking generally. Damn it. Don't think l am talking in an urge. I have experience. You bloody... You know how to extract things. I never think of saying anything to anyone about me. ...but, you make me say it. Okay, I will say. Who? Is this Manju? How are you? Are you fine? Why are you not coming to church? When I was studying, we thought this as a playground and played. Now you've grown old? Problems increased more, father. Confusions are killing me. God will bless you. Forgive me, father. Whatever God it may be... ...if they want to help, can't they help us little quick? Why are you laughing? If he don't know what to do with the gathered applications... ...can't he keep assistants? l am sorry. My mind is very confused, father. I wander here and there to get peace... ...and for that reason, I am here. If I find it from a butcher's shop or a crematorium... ...l am ready to be there. Manju, don't go anywhere in search of peace. It is there with you. But, to understand that, we need belief. I mean faith. You should maintain your mind peacefully before confusion affect you mind. - Father. - Yes my child. l am coming to you. You should turn your mind somewhere else before confusion defeat your mind. Whether it is with God, Music or Literature, you have to do it. God will surely help you. Come, Mano. Dont you know her? It's Manju. Don't you know Mano? My son. Hello, How do you do? What is the matter? Piano has arrived at home, daddy. Here is the bill. Mano plays the piano very well. Come home. I will ask him to play. Let's hear it. Come on. Mano plays the piano really well. Piano music didn't solved my problems, but, it brought comfort to my mind. I found solace to my heart in their home. I felt, I found something, which I searched for so long. So, I used to go there frequently. To see them was my happiness. The way they pray, the silence, the environment of their home... ...had given me a new ray of hope. I thought it was like that. I thought no other place can give me comfort now. Everytime... ...Mano should be with me, I used to think. My mind will get peace... ...whenever I speak and be with him. Whenever I was with him... ...it was always a great pleasure for me. He was like King Solomon of bible... ...standing beside the Queen of Sheba. As you are listening to me now... ...I shared my misery with him as well. These things made me closer to him. I gave up myself to him. Even when I had bitter experience of socialising with a man before... I started to get closer to Mano because of my heart. I remember an old fable. Have you read it? One bird find it's prey on a boat. The bird begins to eat the prey. Suddenly, the boat starts sailing. The bird didn’t know that. While the boat was sailing over the mid sea... ...the bird gets it & understands it has to fly back. It starts to fly to the shore. Even after covering a long distance, there was no shore. Being tired, it fly back to the boat itself. After few days, she tried again & went back... ...after being tired of flying. I have also searched for a true love like that bird. But, I become tired of searching. And, never received the true love. But... It's my bad luck that I never received anything on my hands... ...like searching an Oasis in a desert. Arun, by losing every relationships... ...I was in a deep sorrow. Hey, Manju. What are you doing? Burning the candle. See the candle. It looks beautiful & destroys too. Why this sudden philosophy? When hatred borns, philosophy ablaze. What's the matter? Family matter. Manju, I think you are making too much of your family matter. No. Do you think I just blabber around? I hate my home each and every second... ...when I think about my parents. What is the problem today? While we are on our way to a wedding... Dad asked mom, why don't you wear the saree, I bought for you? Attending the wedding itself is enormous... ...if wearing his saree is important, she asked. I don't understand them. Okay, Manju. Why do you feel bad? They are living a false life by deceiving each other. They are fighting like animals with each other. Seeing this, I get mad. If my father doesn't like her, he should divorce her. Or my mother should get separated. Without doing it, they are leading a shameful life. I feel disgusted seeing them. l am sorry. Mano. Don't leave. l won't feel good, if you leave. With you, I feel there is a way to escape from the misery. That's good. Continue. Relations are like continuous chain of series. Feelings are like a short story. A story ends any time A new one may continue from the end Hereafter everything will be fine I will bear your burden in the chest for you I will be a burden bearer The edge of your eyes is wet for some reasons I will change the shredded tears Pain can be relieved Just let the snow go away Let me join the beautiful white cloud Relations are like continuous chain of series Feelings are like a short story A story ends any time A new one may continue from the end Hereafter everything will be fine Though life is a song, music develops daily There will be happiness everyday What you saw is sufferings Life is full of pleasure from here Happy life begins The new waves in the river mixed with the sea. Our relationship joins today and a new pleasure has born Relations are like continuous chain of series Feelings are like a short story A story ends any time A new one may continue from the end Hereafter everything will be fine Hereafter everything will be fine Mano, what happened? Manju. I feel, I used you through your weakness. I used you for my feelings. I don't know how it happened. Why are you confusing yourself? I thought, you will have wrong ideas about me. I was fearing, you'd think, I would bend for anything. I willingly agreed. Then, why such dilemma? Do you know, how happy I was for the rights you had taken on me? - What are you saying, Manju? - It's the beginning of my decision. - I decided to marry you. - Manju! - Sshhh. Till then, I want you to keep you in silence. Manju, why are you here during this night? What happened? Shall I answer your every question standing outside? l am sorry. Come in. - What's the matter? - Whatever should happen, happened. Oh, Manju. What happened? Fight in the house. Your parents always fights. Because of that during this night... Fight isn't between mom and dad. It's between me and mom. About what? She said, I don't stay in home. I always wander outside. So, they lost their pride. Do you think, I don't know your character, I asked. Manju, questioning you is after all, your mother. - When hen presses... - Sshhhh! Chick dies, when the hen presses her feet on it? Stop that crap. I don't like to hear it. Whatever questions I wanted to ask her the entire time... ...every bit of that, I asked like beating her with a stick. Each and everytime she trembled... ...I felt peace in my heart. Do you know how happy I'm feeling now? Your father wasn't there? Why not? He is a gentleman. I think, he waited long enough to see this. So, he walked out silently. - Your mother didn't said anything? - Of course. She said, she will send me out of home. I'd leave by myself, I replied. She feels, I'll be an orphan if she lefts me, as if I don't have anyone. There is someone who is willing to die for me, how would she know that? - Particularly, she doesn't know about you, Mano. - Manju. - I think you hurried up. - No. When l am with you, I feel very courageous. I don't like to go home. It's only you for me hereafter. Make arrangements for us fast. Yes, yes. Manju, you suddenly came here, so... ...I am not sure what to do. Dad is also out of town. Please, wait here. I will meet my friend and bring some food for you. Mano. Hey, don't worry. Manju. Mano, Is this your friend? Surely, l am his friend, dear. Or else, being mad, you came here alone. Without misbehaving... ...he safely handed you to your father. Isn't he a friend? - Sir. Taxi is waiting outside. - Thank you very much. It's very difficult to see such a good person like you. You behaved like a true Christian. I don't know how to say thanks for this help. I hold my hands and appreciate, dear. What is this, sir? Manju is like my sister. Sister? I am sister? I felt like beating him with my slippers. You know instead of saying sister... ...if he said, whore, I would not have bothered. I didn't understand anything for a minute. Where am I? What am I doing? Everyone is worse and vulture. Eagles that eat corpse are wandering around me. But, you know, I didn't get scared. I was not scared. He talked about many things to me. Of course, I also talked. But I came to a decision, Whatever might come, I will have it face to face. ...without crying behind. Doing it. But, But... I... I don't know... Why... ...I am doing it. Maybe, I am rude. Vulgar. And, unfit. But, Arun... Do you think so? Manju. Manju. Hey... Manju. Manju, what's wrong? Manju? Hey? Get away you bastard. Get away. Get away. - Hey, Manju, Manju, Manju. - Get away. Rascal, get away. Manju, take it easy. Manju, what happened to you? Yeah... Hey, hey... Leave me. - Shit. - Manju, Manju. See. Hey, I am... What, Hey, hey... Manju. Don't be silly, Manju. Don't be silly, Manju. Hey, hey... I will kill you. I will kill you. - Get away from here. - Stupid. Listen to me. Manju. Manju, Manju... Manju, nothing. Hey, hey. Manju, hey. Manju, hey. Manju, hey. Manju. Manju, please. Manju. Manju. Manju, please. Manju. Manju. Cheers. Come on, buddy. Why are you so dull? Are you not feeling well? Hey, whom are you trying to hide from? A person who drinks alcohol has distinct vision. Don't hide from me. Have a ML of alcohol to forget your woes. These old habits... Have a peg. No. Come on, buddy. No. Thank you. To drink wine in order to forget your woes... ...is near escapism. You are escaping from problems by deceiving yourself. That's it. Oh... You are the type of person who face problems straight away, right? Good. Keep it up. What's the problem? That Manju, right? Why are you so interested in that temptress? Why do you crave to help her? Why? Note here. She has so much pain, so many heartbreaks... ...from childhood... ...she experienced different types of pain. She just don't know what to do. Buddy, you are still a child. You don't know the world. She knows the world. Shall I suggest a solution? All she needs... ...is a man. Not for safety... ...but to sleep with. Yes, man. Buddy, There are two factors causes misery in the world. One is poverty. The other is death. There is a substitute for everything in the world... ...except two things. Which are... One is money. The other is life. Look, dear, Arun. People talk about love, this, that & all... ...are meaningless, buddy. Change of reaction that happens in the body... ...named as love. Some are pleased with it while some others aren't... ...like Manju. Hey, buddy. I'll say the truth. Because, I drank alcohol. So, I have to speak truth only. I have to respect alcohol, isn't it? Girls should not have two addiction. One is of physical pleasure and the other is of self-independency. The sex frenzy lady won't be... ...happy with anybody. It's impossible. Because, she will crave for more. She won't be happy and won't let others to be happy. The other one is addiction of living independent. The ladies are always dependent. While they born, they are dependent... ...to their parents. When they attain puberty they are dependent... ...to husband. When they grow old, they are dependent on their children. Then, how could they be independent? Manju is addicted to both of these traits. They are not fit for the family. They should not get married. Don't think, I am blabbering. Drinkers only speaks the truth. How could you say that Manju is in search of peace? Hasn't she met a man of her choice yet? Or whether she is willing to marry God like Meera or Andal? Arun, basically... ...her crave might never get fulfilled. And, I'm unsure on her independency. She appears to have an affair with different males daily. Today, it's you. Tomorrow, it might be me. Then, somebody else. She is a self pitying, sex-starved bitch. Please, stop that. Sarath, have you found a model for the advertisement? Not yet. They have to pose boldly. What do you mean boldly? It means without clothes. If you want bold pose, why searching outside? Our Manju would look beautiful. Excellent suggestion. But, not sure if she will accept it. We will tell her about people's choice. If she accepts, it's our luck. Sarath sir... Do you think, Manju's features would look good? - Fantastic. - How are you so sure? - Who knows her better than me? - I know. Why, Mr. Sarathy? Shall I suggest a better candidate than me? Because you know her features in detail. What? I am suggesting your wife. How is it? Manju, speak carefully. I'm quiet cause you are a lady. I am quiet cause I don't want you to get beaten up by a lady. Why are you using, da? (calling men informally) How can I use di? (calling women informally) Are you a lady? See what I do. What can you do? You are the person who rubs the ladies in motorcycle. - Manju... - Shit. What is the problem? Manju, what is this? They are taking off clothes, sir. I mean mentally undressing. Without calling God Krishna here... ...I thought, let me save myself. Shut up. Behave yourself. That depends on others behaviours, sir. Meet me in my room. Manju, you are the only reason for such disruptions. Your activity bothers everyone. Everyone is complaining about you... ...in the office. But, I've never taken any action. Why? Arguement with Sarathy, Fight with Seethalakshmi... ...not talking with Chandran. Recently met Arun... ...you are spoiling him also. Spoil? What do you mean? I mean what I say, dear, Manju. If you think, you want to do any help for me... ...I mean for office... Keep away. I have to do good thing for your office, right? I resign. Bye. Manju. Hey... ...is it true what I've heard? What have you heard? That you resigned your job. That's it? I thought... ...you'd ask about Vizhipuram's rain issue or Test tube baby... I think you left the job in a hurry. What are you going to do now? I'm going to put this coin. What, sir, only job has lost, did anyone died? Mr. Arun. Play from here, I will bring the coffee. Manju, I don't know what happened in your office... ...but, I will talk to Thyagu and get back your job. What pleasure would you get by rubbing his back? Sir, I know how to tackle Thyagu. Kala, bring the coffee fast. Basically, Thyagu is a very good guy. What, Mr. Arun, you have put a coin! Hmm. He was giving me conduct certificate. Manju. You. Why can't I call you in singular? After Kala, nobody understands you better than me. Walking through the thorns and stones made you talk... ...so tiredly in pain. I should pour water on the fire or should I jump into it? I feel, I am climbing a mountain alone. Why and for what I am climbing? I don't know. Is he showing mercy or love? I don't understand. I can't afford to lose my mind again. I had that strength before. But now, I don't. Whenever I think... ...this relation puzzles me again and again. I am unable to cut this relation. Kala, how are you like this? How do you live without any dilemma? How is it possible for you? Dear Scented Flowers Sing the tone my heart dances like you by touching a new rhythm and by putting a new tone Dear Scented Flowers Sing the tone my heart dances like you by touching a new rhythm and by putting a new tone Male thirst quenches On female sex whose sin is this man made law who put the circle hopefully that's it this is feminine whose curse is this Justice are common but gone away without understanding Dear Scented Flowers Sing the tone my heart dances like you by touching a new rhythm and by putting a new tone Panchali had lived a miserable life No one is there to admire her in real life God belonging to many people himself asked to sing praises on this earth Justice are common but gone away without understanding Dear Scented Flowers Sing the tone my heart dances like you by touching a new rhythm and by putting a new tone Hey, hey... shit! I told you to send a teenage girl for the party. You sent an old-age girl. Okay, leave it. No glamour, No age. I thought humour would be there. That was missing too. You only know those five girls of your note. Look. Next time, send a good girl after doing a good checkup. Medical checkup, man. What? Who? Sundari? Those product works before becoming MD. Look someone to match up after becoming MD. See my status. Who? Yeah, yeah. What's the matter now, buddy? I am here to talk an important matter. Oh. Forgot to say... Your Manju... ...resigned her job. Do you know? - You know? - Yes. So, your wish on her hasn't faded away. Nothing like that. Didn't you asked, why she resigned her job? Let there be some reason. I know she left the office. I don't need to know, why she left the office. Gentleman. I don't like digging the matters. Gentleman. How can I know when she didn't said anything to me? Knowing everything, you let her go. How can I know everything? I just know about my office and about women. Look, buddy. You don't know about women. You involved too much. She is a poison. Hey, you always talk like this about Manju. She talks very openly. Otherwise, she is a very harmless person you know. Talk to you on Manju is like talk to the vendors, criticising their goods. But... ...she is very efficient girl. - Okay, if she comes back, will you appoint her? - If I appoint her, you'll be very happy, no? - Surely. But, whether she will rejoin is a doubt. For your kind information, my dear buddy. The temptress rejoined her job... ...before eight hours itself. Call for Susila. I have an important matter to talk. - What happened? Got it? - Line is having some problem, madam. Check the line by ringing another number. Give me. What's the number? 71961, madam. Line is perfect. I think you've dialled some wrong number. Hello. Which number have I called? Hello. I am sorry. I don't know the number I dialled. What's your number please? This is 74135. I am Arun here. I am Manju here. Oh! Hello. What a surprise! I knew you would call me for sure. How did you expected my call? I had gone to office and met Thyagu. Okay, I am leaving the call... ...MD will think I am on a personal call & scold me. Hello. Manju, have you rejoined the job? I was sure, you would rejoin. You called me for saying that, isn't it? Yes. So what? I am unable to understand you. You came Madras to understand me? Whose face inspired you to go back at your job again? Who sees face, sir? I thought, I should go back. So, I went. If I feel like coming back, I will. Do I have to inform you and work? Okay, I am keeping the phone. We don't talk much about it because it isn't actually relevant in India. - What is relevant in India? - It's not actually been practised out here. What do you think about... ...premarital sex and legalized abortion? No answer? I agree with legalized abortion. - Sorry. - I agree with legalized abortion. - You do agree? - Yeah. So, you also do agree about premarital sex? - I am not clear. - That depends. It depends the way you are. It is not accepted in India. You see. Sorry, ladies. The film has gone out. So, we will continue with the sound alone. Any of you... ...belongs to any political organisation? or Party? No, No. - None of you? - No. Don't you have faith in Indian politics or no interest in it? We don't know about that. We don't want that at this age. So... ...you are not ready to know about politics? - Yes. At this stage, we aren't bothered about that. Have you heard about the concept of Women's liberation? Take the photo first. Women's liberation is a new concept. Your grandma were not been able to cast votes. But, you can vote today. So, you got freedom. Women's are going for jobs. What do you think about it? - Do you think it's good? Or, bad? - It's good. - Is it good? - Yes. Next... Before, you were living like slaves. Means you were dependent to men. - You were like machines to men for giving birth to babies. - Yes. - What's you opinion about it? - Now a days we are driving car, plane... ...auto, bike, earning more money. Yes, cycle also. {Crowd Speaking} I want to speak. They wore pant, shirt. And, feel stylish exposing themselves. - Is it good? - It's good or bad? - Bad. - What's wrong in it? - What, why? Why would they wear only saree and cook and sit inside the house? Cook and sit inside the house? Now we have rights. We go to jobs. We learn good manners. {Crowd speaking} {Crowd speaking} Right, you say now. Men who are drunkard. Who keep two wives. Who are having a set up. - Do you feel like you should also get drunk and have a set up? - Yes. We should. Of course, we should. We should. Yes, we should. Without saying, it's fate and keep pacifying yourself... That's what you are doing till date. How would you change these? We will vote. What do you think of family planning? Is family planning good? Yes, it is. If we've many babies, we may not be able to grow them well. One or two is enough. - So, you're saying, family planning is good? - Yes. - Some are saying, God has planted the tree so, he will water the plants. - Nothing like that. And, what do you think about the Parda system? Like in a salable commodity, being a cellophane tape... - Covering a women using Parda. - No, it's not a continuing thing. Are you saying the women who tolerates their husband... ...whatever husband do to them, beat them and all is correct? - Women bears everything. - That's life, isn't it? - Are you saying that's life? - Yes. Manju... ...when was the last time we met? I don't keep accounts. I was busy with my documentary work. I think you are angry. Just like you, if everybody takes business as happiness... ...how good that would be. Manju. It's time to talk some matter openly to you. My documentary isn't the only reason... ...for not meeting you so long. It's also because of your conflicted behaviour. You resigned the job. You rejected my help to talk to MD and rejoined the job by yourself. I don't understand, why are you doing all this? Who lives without having confliction? We are humans cause we face confliction. Manju, listen to me, you should be more careful. Why? Why means the way you have developed your image... You know, what others are saying about you? What? She only needs a man, that's all... ...they are saying. I feel very bad hearing all these. Why do you feel bad? Shall I say, who said like this? No. Having a fight around it was not my intention. Okay, stop it. I am in a hurry to go to a party. Hey... Do you know, whom I'm going with? Dear, Arun... Eventhough, we don't write letters to each other... ...we understand each other very well. We didn't lived as father and son. I wish to see you with a bride before passing away. I have given you full freedom. I have given you freedom in your marriage life too. If you love anybody, I will fulfill your wish. If not, marry the girl of my choice. Please, consider my health and accept my wish. Your dearest father. Come on, Arun. Sit down. How are you? - I am going to my native place. I am going out of here. - What? In 10'o clock bus. Why so suddenly? The work for which I came, my documentary is finished. Does Manju know? Won't you say it to her? I don't want to say. Why? My dignity left with me, doesn't allow me to say. I was with her for so many days. I am still unable to understand her. I am with her for five years. Even, I don't undestand her. Let her feel proud being an unsolved puzzle. - But, I have no patience. - She is a good person. Let her be. I accept it. She is in... with you! - It's true. - I am not ready to believe that. But, I am saying it truly, I like her. Then, you should openly talk to her on this, right? It's no use. I don't know if she has any trust in family, marriage and relationships. I don't know if she will take my love in a funny way or strict way. But, Kala... I have no hatred towards Manju. I still like her. But, I don't understand her activity or motives. I think... ...we have to enjoy her standing away. But, not by getting close to her. She is a tigress caught inside cage. We can see her from outside. Can we go inside and enjoy? Her help to my work and the experience she has given me... ...I will never forget. For that, convey my thanks to her. Tell her not to get angry on my decision. You too, don't worry. She only needs a man, that's all... they are saying. She only needs a man, that's all... they are saying. She only needs a man, that's all... they are saying. She only needs a man, that's all... they are saying. Shall we leave? If you want to leave immediately, you can go. You came up alone while party is still on, so I asked. Wrong, dear. During night, woman shouldn't be alone. They should be with their partner. You should have one for yourself then. Are you scared of unlocked door? The fear has gone. What next? What? Lamp is too bright for you? I have never seen such a lady... ...who is so co-operative. Yes, because... ...all I need is a man. - Isn't that what you are saying everywhere? - What's wrong with her? - Let me tackle. - Look... Let me tell you something. Yes, I need a man. But, it's not you. Scold me slowly. Somebody might hear. Let them. Let them see. - I am your MD. - Get out. - MD, Manging director. - Get out. What happened to you? You are not even asking me to come in. I am here to share my happiness with you... ...and you are keeping your face dull. Won't you ask me what happened? Okay. Let me tell you. Don't you know about my MD, Thyagu? Whenever he tried to get close with me... ...I felt very angry. I resigned the job on that day, becoming angry on him. But, I felt uneasy on my mind. Something crouching you down & down type feeling. I had to wait for the... ...right time to take revenge. So... I rejoined the office immediately after the day I resigned. Everyone got surprised, especially Mr. Arun. He become so confused. When he came to ask for an explanation, I get rid of him like a cockroach. I have to say sorry for everything. I've to tell him what I think. That is... I... do... him. I... do... him! I am ordering Princess Kala to speak... Why are you simply sitting? What is there to speak? My stomach is burning. I am very happy that you got... ...a good man's friendship. But, without understanding anything, you hurt him heavily. Do you never understood how much he loves you by his activity? To offer you a new life... ...he tried a lot. But, you never understood. Okay. Okay. What I have done is wrong. I am a dog's tail, it can't get straightened. I will go and ask him sorry, holding his legs. Not possible. Arun has already left this town. Yes. You lost him & you deserve it. Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me. Thank you. Thyagu, I don't know how to write anything. We will talk things directly. Reserve a room for me in a hotel. While I was alone, you were with me. Meet me at the station tomorrow. Arun. I read an excellent joke. A girl, in her application form, in the special qualification column... ...has written that she has no bad habit, but is ready to learn them. She got the job immediately. How is it? Manju. Hey, Manju. Why does your face looks so dull? Oh, you still thinking about that party incident? Stupid. I behaved like a man the way... ...he would behave with a lonely girl. You behaved like a lonely woman the way she would behave to save her dignity. Done & dusted. Is it something to think about? I need your help. Oh, by all means. I still have the quality to help the beautiful ladies. What? Tell me. - Shall I close the door? - I want to meet, Mr. Arun. Where is he? You need to see Arun? That's it? I will take you. Why nobody is speaking and going on like a silent rally? Mr. Arun. Have you asked her the question, you ask to every women? Okay, let me ask. Dear... She is asking, what do you think of women's liberation? - I don't know anything about that. - Very safe answer. That is why you are happy. Driver, stop the car. I have to get down here.
